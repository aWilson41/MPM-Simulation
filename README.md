# MPM-Simulation
Note: Still doesn't work yet. Unstable, not sure why. Looked over it 100 times. Perhaps this is as stable as an explicit solve will get?

Material Point Method Simulation. Includes my own graphics abstraction. Requires GLEW, GLFW, GLM, and Eigen. Make the project with the CMakeLists.txt file.
